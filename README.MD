## Clone Repository
on the cmd, Run     
git clone https://github.com/henrylebile85/Hudl.git  

Navigate to the cloned project   
cd hudl  

## Setting up a new Virtual environment or activating the Virtual environment within the project
- Activate the Virtual Environment within the hudl project venv (venv_hudl1)   
  ‚ö†Ô∏è As it is not best practice to share the project's venv, I would withhold and only provide this upon request  
  Execute command from the hudl project   

  - Windows {bash}(Command Prompt):    
    venv_hudl1\Scripts\activate    

  - Windows (PowerShell):    
    venv_hudl1\Scripts\Activate.ps1   

  - Mac/Linux(bash)   
    source venv_hudl1/bin/activate      

- Deactivate the Virtual Environment      
  deactivate 

- Create a Virtual Environment   
  python -m venv virtual_environment_name   
  Note: command for python 3 and above  

## Update pip 
- Run      
  pip install --upgrade pip   


## Install dependencies  
- Confirm if dependencies are already installed   

  pip freeze from the venv_hudl virtual environment or from the newly created virtual environment   
  
  If dependencies are installed, proceed to setting the environment variables  

- Install dependencies 

  If dependencies are not installed, re-install them from the requirements.txt file   

  pip install -r requirements.txt   

Note: If you create a new virtual environment, you would need to install all the dependencies from the 
requirements.txt file 

## Set Environment Variables
- Set Browser environment variable to select the desired browser to run the test 
  - For windows use any of the following, depending on the browser you want to run (no spaces in x=x )      
    set BROWSER=chrome  
    set BROWSER=firefox   

  - For apple use any of the following, depending on the browser you want to run (no spaces in x=x )     
    export BROWSER=chrome  
    export BROWSER=firefox  
    export BROWSER=safari ‚ùå **NOT STABLE** at best can only run 1 test at a time         

- Set REGISTERED_EMAIL and VALID_PASSWORD from .env **or** from system environment variables
  - Set from .env.example: 
    - change .env.example to .env   
      cp .env.example .env   
    
    - Then open the .env file and adjust the variable with the correct credentials, under 
      REGISTERED_EMAIL 
      VALID_PASSWORD 
  - Set it from entering the system environment variable 
    - For windows use set (no spaces in x=x )      
      set BROWSER=REGISTERED_EMAIL  
      set BROWSER=VALID_PASSWORD   

    - For apple use export (no spaces in x=x )      
      export BROWSER=REGISTERED_EMAIL   
      export BROWSER=VALID_PASSWORD   
    
  üìå **Note:** run the python script credential_management.py to confirm your credentials have been registered      
      python credentials.py   
      
- Set Test Environment **(Not required)**
  - prod is set as the default value.  
    For the purpose of this Hudl exercise, we would be using only prod  

- üìå **(Optional):** Set html Report Directory 
  - For windows use any of the following (no spaces in x=x )      
    set RESULTS_DIR=then enter the absolute path of where you want the file to be stored e.g. reports   

  - For apple use any of the following (no spaces in x=x )   
    export RESULTS_DIR=then enter the absolute path of where you want the file to be stored e.g. reports  

## Run Test and Generate Reports  
- Navigate to the hudl package   
  cd hudl   

- Execute tests from the hudl package  
  Run command   
  pytest -m login -n auto --html=Reports/report.html --self-contained-html   

## Check Test Reports 
- Default location   
  Reports are located in the hudl package under Reports  
  üòä your current directory  

- Environment Variable location 
  the reports would be located üìå **(here):** the absolute path of where you want the file to be stored
